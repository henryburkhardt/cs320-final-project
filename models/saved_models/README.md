# Model Files 
- `model_2`: first functional model, trained on `snake2_game_output.csv`
  - This model only avoids edges, has no other logic. It should stay alive forever though. This is the sucessful MVP. 

- `model_3`: still needs to get made 
  - can be trained starting with model1 logic and then using re-enforcement learning with a custom loss function to get better at actually playing the game
