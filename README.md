# C230 Final Project: Snake Game played by AI
Riaz Kelly and Henry Burkhardt 

Our final project was divided into to approaches Neural Networks, and Q-learning. To make things easier we have divided each of these approaches into their own notebooks. The Neural Network work can be found inside the `neural_network` folder, and the Q-learning work can be found in the `q_learning` folder. We kept the game logic in a central folder called `game`. 

We've included our write up in the markdown file `WRITEUP.md`.

To run the Q-learning code, navigate into the `q_learning` directory and run `python q_learning.py`
When you run the Q-learning model, if it doesn't start printing out something to the console after 5 seconds you should stop it and run the program again. This is an unresolved bug, but everything should work!
