# C230 Final Project: Snake Game played by AI
Riaz Kelly and Henry Burkhardt 

Our final project was divided into to approaches Neural Networks, and Q-learning. To make things easier we have divided each of these approaches into their own notebooks. The Neural Network work can be found inside the `neural_network` folder, and the Q-learning work can be found in the `q_learning` folder. We kept the game logic in a central folder called `game`. 

We've included out write up in the markdown file `WRITEUP.md`.
